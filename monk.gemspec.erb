It means that instead of installing all the tools you need for your projects, you can rely on a git repository and a list of dependencies, and Monk will care of the rest. By default, it ships with a Sinatra application that includes Contest, Stories, Webrat, Ohm and some other niceties, along with a structure and helpful documentation to get your hands wet in no time."
